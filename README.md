This is a simple Rock / Paper / Scissors game created by me using mostly 'if - elif - else' conditions Python.

The rules are simple, you select either Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer picks among the same options randomly. The outcome is based on the below conditions:

There are five rounds per game. Either the player or computer gets more points and the game ends. In the end, the player has the option to restart it, or exit.

In cases where either the computer or player gets 3 wins to nill, the game also ends.
